One good thing about your UML that I am going to put into my design is making the 
User Interface the center of sorts. On mine currently the User Interface is calling the 
wrong thing and the code ultimately wouldn't work out the way it should. One bad thing
however, is the line going from Menu to Menu Option, the line is all weird and the 
arrow is pointing in the wrong direction. Easy fix though. Also, it doesn't hurt but I 
think Erik said you don't need to put the Bingo class in your UML. One thing you should 
try to fix is make sure all the arrows actually hit the boxes because in the design you 
sent me they are off by a little bit and it looks weird. You could also leave off the 
‘none’ that you put in the User Interface class. I think you could just leave it empty 
and it would work just as well. The none could be perceived as a variable and not you 
saying that there is no variables in the class. One thing you could do as well is bring 
all of the classes closer together so that way it isn't so wide. You don't need all the 
white space in between. Overall I think you did a bang up job with your UML and as soon 
as you fix a few little nit-picky issues with the arrows and the ‘none’ in the 
User Interface and it will be near perfect.
