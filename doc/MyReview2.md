Your UML overall is very good. The lines are easy to follow and the spacing
looks really good. Everything in this seems to be right. The only thing I would 
really change with this is adding the ‘+’ and ‘-‘ before all your variables and methods, 
the ‘+’ for public and the ‘-‘ for private. This way when you actually begin coding,
 you’re going to know how to focus your efforts and make you the most efficient. 
As you have it right now, I can see that when you begin coding you can easily get 
confused and not sure exactly how your methods should work. The other suggestion 
I have for you is to make your lines a little straighter. While they are still easy to
follow and look good, I think making them straight and to the point it is going to 
work better for the readability and make it look quite a bit cleaner. Readability 
is super important in UML because it is supposed to help explain to people what your 
code will do. However, the great part about UML is the flexibility. 
Despite the few issues with this it will be very easy to change it and make it even better.
On top of that it isn’t your code so you don’t have to worry about messing anything up, 
because you can just change it later if you decide that you want your 
classes to look different or your variables or even if you want to add more. 
You’re very close to having this done!
