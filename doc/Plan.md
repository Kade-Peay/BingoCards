# 1. Requirements

Create a program that will be able to create bingo cards of various sizes with each 
card being randomized. Then be able to save the entire deck of cards.


# 2. Design

The program will continually prompt the user to do different actions with the 
deck of cards.


## Input

A menu prompts the user to and gives them a set of options. This includes a seperate
menu after the deck has been created where the menu now shows options to interact with
the deck.

## Processing

The processing will be handled using the different menu options and classes. What is 
processed is up to the user.


## Output

All of the information is printed using the menu or format and print the information of 
the card.


# 3. Implementation

* The program is contained in the 'src/bingo.py'
* The user is then prompted through the use of various menus.
* If the user asks to print the specific card is is printed using the proper format.


# 4. Verification

*Describe at least two test cases that can detect the presence (or absence) of
bugs in your program.  These could be bugs that you encountered while
implementing your program.  If you didn't come across any bugs (lucky you!)
