Kaden's Review

While I like what the UML has to offer from the outset, one area in which I 
think you could improve the UML design is in the arrows. While they are a bit finicky,
 getting them to correctly link functions and calls to other classes will help you and 
the graders see the relationships between your classes better. This will probably help a 
lot while actually doing the coding, as it's helped me with my own mental planning. 
The only other nitpick I have is following the conventions lined out in lecture. 
Using a (+) for public and a (-) for private variables and methods makes it much easier 
to read. Same goes for the naming conventions for variables and methods 
(lower and upper camel case). Otherwise things end up out of line with one another 
and it becomes something of an eyesore.

Other than that, I think the UML will be a good stepping stone for you to 
jump into the project. One thing I think you should take into consideration 
when doing so is almost directly flowing from the UML into your software development plan.
 I currently have several of the methods I’ll be using sketched out into my notebook 
and it’s helped a ton with me being able to not only visualize the end result,
 but the process it will take to get there. However, I can definitely tell that you 
are already well on that path to enlightenment. I also appreciate how open the UML 
is to future changes.
